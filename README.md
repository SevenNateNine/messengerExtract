# messengerExtract
Goal is to use Messenger's search function and screenshot EVERY instance of a searched word. 

## Tools 
* Will use Selenium to interact with Messenger, may consider an API but this project is to expand my web scraping skills. 

## Basic Functionality
* Simple GUI appears, enter Username, Email, Conversation, and Word(s) you want to search up
* Bot will then go through all instances that was searched up and screenshot each instance so that you may look through it later.
* Result will be a folder of images containing the key word you want. 

## Possible Advanced Functionality
* Save the whole conversation from beginning to end
* If no Conversation is specified than all Conversations will be searched
* Image Compare: prevent overlapping screenshots by comparing the images to one another, can also be done during the scrape to "speed" up the process (i.e., if a similar image or images are found than cease the scrape (since it's chronological)).
